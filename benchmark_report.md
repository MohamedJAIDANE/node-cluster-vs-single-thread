# Node.js Blocking vs Clustered Mode Benchmark Report

## Overview
This benchmark compares a basic Node.js server running in single-threaded mode versus a clustered mode to evaluate how blocking operations impact performance.

## Tested URLs
- http://localhost:3081/block
- http://localhost:3000/block

## üîç Detailed Breakdown

### üî∏ Port 3081

- **Total Time:** Took 25 seconds to complete 5 requests with 5 concurrent clients.
- **Performance:** Very slow ‚Äî each request took on average 25 seconds, even though they were made concurrently.
- **Processing Time:** Requests took between 5s and 20s to complete.
- **Waiting Time:** Very high, with most requests waiting the full 20s.
- **Response Pattern:** All 5 requests appear to be waiting on a blocking operation with the same timeout (~20s), suggesting a blocking or long-running task in the backend for `/block`.

**Interpretation:**

Your backend on port 3081 is heavily blocking the request or has some artificial or real delay (~20s). This could be due to:

- Synchronous blocking code (e.g., sleep, long computation)
- External network call with long response time
- Intentional test for blocking behavior

---

### üî∏ Port 3000

- **Total Time:** Completed in 10 seconds
- **Performance:** Slightly better ‚Äî each request took ~5 seconds to complete, even with concurrency.
- **Processing Time:** Very consistent, all requests returned in ~5004 ms ¬± 1 ms.
- **Waiting Time:** Same as processing, indicating that responses are queued instantly and served after 5 seconds.

**Interpretation:**

Port 3000 backend is also blocking for 5 seconds per request, but all requests execute in parallel (due to async/non-blocking code). The uniform response time suggests:

- Probably using asynchronous delay (e.g., setTimeout, await sleep(5000))
- No serious contention or CPU blocking
- Requests are handled concurrently and efficiently

## ‚öñÔ∏è Comparison: 3081 vs 3000

| Aspect                | Port 3081 (likely blocking)      | Port 3000 (likely async)          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Concurrency Efficiency | Poor ‚Äì requests block each other | Good ‚Äì requests handled in parallel |
| Mean Response Time     | 25s total, 20s per request       | 10s total, 5s per request         |
| Consistency of Response| High variance (5s‚Äì20s)            | Low variance (~5s all)            |
| Throughput            | 0.2 req/sec                     | 0.5 req/sec                      |
